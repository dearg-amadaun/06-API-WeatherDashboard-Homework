## Notes
Rough project, still struggling with figuring out how to do everything I need to do in javascript. Tried to use bootstrap exclusively to see exactly what I could do with only moderate success, some things work and are where I want them, other things I could not figure out how to properly format to get them where I wanted. Definitely does not meet all criteria but pleased with what I did manage even with the help of multiple tutorials on all fronts.

Current Functionality Level: User can search for the current weather in any city. Will work with my tutor and resubmit.

-Need to figure out how to properly call the UV index from open weather
-Need to find out more about how the 5 day forecast api call works vs the current weather so I can populate the forecast cards appropriately
-Need to find out how to correctly call icons from open weather
-need to store previous searches in local storage and display them on screen
