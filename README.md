## Notes
Rough project, still struggling with figuring out how to do everything I need to do in javascript. Tried to use bootstrap exclusively to see exactly what I could do with only moderate success, some things work and are where I want them, other things I could not figure out how to properly format to get them where I wanted. Definitely does not meet all criteria but pleased with what I did manage even with the help of multiple tutorials on all fronts.

Current Functionality Level: User can search for the current weather in any city.

-Need to figure out how to properly call the UV index from open weather
-Need to find out more about how the 5 day forecast api call works vs the current weather so I can populate the forecast cards appropriately
-Need to find out how to correctly call icons from open weather
-need to store previous searches in local storage and display them on screen

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
